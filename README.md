# Machine_Learning_examples
In this mini project, I have experimented and trained models on various machine learning concepts. Different datasets are being used in different files. 
Some major concepts used are : 
 (1) Linear Regression and Data Processing with pandas
 (2) Logistic Regression
 (3) Regression with Gradient Descent and step
length algorithms
 (4) Linear Classification with Stochastic Gradient
Descent and AdaGrad
 (5) Regularization, Validation protocols and
Hyperparameter optimization
 (6) Generalized Linear Models and High Dimensional Data [Scikit Learn]
 (7) Decision Trees and quality criterion
 (8) Nearest-Neighbor Models (kNN)
 (9) Perceptron and Support Vector Machines [libsvm/liblinear]
(10) Factorization Models and Recommender System [libmf]
(11) Clustering (K-means)
(12) Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
(13) Frequent Pattern Mining
(14) Reinforcement Learning
